Data Scientist Role Play: Profiling and Analyzing the Yelp Dataset Coursera Worksheet

This is a 2-part assignment. In the first part, you are asked a series of questions that will help you profile and understand the data just like a data scientist would. For this first part of the assignment, you will be assessed both on the correctness of your findings, as well as the code you used to arrive at your answer. You will be graded on how easy your code is to read, so remember to use proper formatting and comments where necessary.

In the second part of the assignment, you are asked to come up with your own inferences and analysis of the data for a particular research question you want to answer. You will be required to prepare the dataset for the analysis you choose to do. As with the first part, you will be graded, in part, on how easy your code is to read, so use proper formatting and comments to illustrate and communicate your intent as required.

For both parts of this assignment, use this "worksheet." It provides all the questions you are being asked, and your job will be to transfer your answers and SQL coding where indicated into this worksheet so that your peers can review your work. You should be able to use any Text Editor (Windows Notepad, Apple TextEdit, Notepad ++, Sublime Text, etc.) to copy and paste your answers. If you are going to use Word or some other page layout application, just be careful to make sure your answers and code are lined appropriately.
In this case, you may want to save as a PDF to ensure your formatting remains intact for you reviewer.

+------------------------+--------+--------------+

8. Does posing more reviews correlate with more fans? Yes

	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:

The following code classifies each user depending on their review count (high, medium or low number of comments), then returns a table that gives the average number of fans for each group:

SELECT CASE

	WHEN review_count > 1000

	THEN "1-high"

	WHEN review_count < 1000 AND review_count > 150

	THEN "2-medium"

	ELSE "3-low"

	END comm_type

, avg(fans)
FROM user

GROUP BY comm_type

Returns this table:

+-----------+----------------+
| comm_type |      avg(fans) |
+-----------+----------------+
| 1-high    |        129.625 |
| 2-medium  |   25.903030303 |
| 3-low     | 0.549679155454 |
+-----------+----------------+

As we can see, the "high" users have a lot more comments than the "medium" users, who themselves have more fans than the "low" users.
We can then deduce that yes, the number of fans is correlated to the number of comments.

9. Are there more reviews with the word "love" or with the word "hate" in them?

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

SELECT sum(text LIKE "%love%") AS love

, sum(text LIKE "%hate%") AS hate

FROM review
	
	
10. Find the top 10 users with the most fans:

	SQL code used to arrive at answer:

| Lissa     |  120 |    455 |    150 |
+-----------+------+--------+--------+
	
	Please explain your findings and interpretation of the results:
	There is a strong relationship between being listed as useful and funny and having a high number of fans.
	Out of the 10 users with the most fans, 9 are highly listed as both being useful and funny.
	
	

Part 2: Inferences and Analysis

1. Pick one city and category of your choice and group the businesses in that city or category by their overall star rating. Compare the businesses with 2-3 stars to the businesses with 4-5 stars and answer the following questions. Include your code.
	
i. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different distribution of hours?
	I choosed to work on the businesses of the city of Edinburgh. Due to most of the businesses not having their hour included in the dataset, only one business has more than 4 stars, and one has 2-3 stars. They have different opening hours but it is certainly due to their category.

ii. Do the two groups you chose to analyze have a different number of reviews?
         Yes, as shown here the poorly rated businesses have in general less reviews

+---------------+----------+
|       avg_rev | Stars    |
+---------------+----------+
| 9.19565217391 | LowStar  |
| 12.3970588235 | HighStar |
+---------------+----------+
Code below
         
iii. Are you able to infer anything from the location data provided between these two groups? Explain.

I checked if there was a difference of noticeable neighborhood between the best and the poorly rated businesses in Edinburgh.
For this I show in the following table the total number of businesses and compare it to the number of businesses where anything appeared in the "Neighborhood" column from the business table.
+---------------+---------------+----------+
| TotalBusiness | NeighborCount | Rating   |
+---------------+---------------+----------+
|            49 |            37 | LowStar  |
|           136 |           119 | HighStar |
+---------------+---------------+----------+
Code below.

There is no noticeable difference between the ratio "TotalBusiness/NeighborCount", then the users rating is not affected by the noticeable neighborhood in Edinburgh.

SQL code used for analysis:

i.

SELECT hours.hours

FROM hours INNER JOIN business

ON business.id = hours.business_id

AND business.city = "Edinburgh"

AND business.stars >= 4


SELECT hours.hours

FROM hours INNER JOIN business

ON business.id = hours.business_id

AND business.city = "Edinburgh"

AND business.stars <=3

AND business.stars >=2


ii.

SELECT avg (review_count) AS avg_rev

, "LowStar" AS Stars

FROM business

WHERE stars <=3

AND stars >=2
AND city = "Edinburgh"



UNION



SELECT avg (review_count)

, "HighStar"

FROM business

WHERE stars >=4

AND city = "Edinburgh"


iii.

SELECT (SELECT count(*)

    FROM business

    WHERE stars >=4

    AND city = "Edinburgh") AS TotalBusiness

, count(*) AS NeighborCount

, "HighStar" AS Rating

FROM business

WHERE stars >=4

AND neighborhood LIKE "_%"

AND city = "Edinburgh"



UNION


SELECT (SELECT count(*)

    FROM business

    WHERE stars <=3

    AND city = "Edinburgh")

, count(*)

, "LowStar"
FROM business

WHERE stars <=3

AND stars >=2
AND neighborhood LIKE "_%"

AND city = "Edinburgh"
		
		
2. Group business based on the ones that are open and the ones that are closed. What differences can you find between the ones that are still open and the ones that are closed? List at least two differences and the SQL code you used to arrive at your answer.
		
i. Difference 1:
         The closed businesses have in average less reviews than the open ones.

+---------+---------------+
| is_open |        rating |
+---------+---------------+
|       0 | 23.1980263158 |
|       1 | 31.7570754717 |
+---------+---------------+
Code below
         
ii. Difference 2:
         The open businesses have a lot more pictures shared than the closed ones.
+---------+---------+
| is_open | Pict_Nb |
+---------+---------+
|       0 |      66 |
|       1 |     585 |
+---------+---------+
Code Below
         
SQL code used for analysis:
i.
SELECT is_open

,avg(review_count) AS reviews

FROM business

GROUP BY is_open
	
ii.
SELECT business.is_open

,count(photo.id) AS Pict_Nb

FROM business INNER JOIN photo

ON business.id = photo.business_id

GROUP BY is_open


	
3. For this last part of your analysis, you are going to choose the type of analysis you want to conduct on the Yelp dataset and are going to prepare the data for analysis.

Ideas for analysis include: Parsing out keywords and business attributes for sentiment analysis, clustering businesses to find commonalities or anomalies between them, predicting the overall star rating for a business, predicting the number of fans a user will have, and so on. These are just a few examples to get you started, so feel free to be creative and come up with your own problem you want to solve. Provide answers, in-line, to all of the following:
	
i. Indicate the type of analysis you chose to do:
         I will parse out keywords and business attributes for a sentiment analysis on restaurants. The goal of this analysis is to get the general feelings of customers about different restaurants. The conclusions will be correlated with the business attributes in order to find what critera are the most important to the consumers in a restaurant.
         
ii. Write 1-2 brief paragraphs on the type of data you will need for your analysis and why you chose that data:
         I need first to parse the keywords in order deduce the general feeling about a business. On a second time I will need to add the business attribute in order to correlate with it the conclusions of the first part of the analysis.

	For the first part I need to filter the restaurants businesses (category) that have a review count superior to 0 and link it to the text of the reviews. In order to run faster the analysis, only the business id and the comment text will be choosen. The business id is important because it allows to differenciate the different businesses and will make the link with the business attributes in the second part. The review text is the part that will be parsed. No other column is necessary.
	The full attribute table is the ony thing needed for the second part. Only the restaurants with at least one review will be filtered once again to optimise the runtimme.
                  
iii. Output of your finished dataset:

|                        | I ordered a lamb biryani. There was a mistake in my order, so I told the manager about it.

| 1ZnVfS-qP19upP_fwOhZsA | My brother was in town and wanted to get a quick lunch before I had to go into work. Wanted to go into Monta but it was 11 and they weren't open yet, so we stopped in at the Big Wong.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |

|                        | Beef Ramen - for 5 you can get a bowl of ramen (same noodles as used at Monta) and it comes with big chunks of beef. They'll ask you for tendons too and I don't remember if they charge you extra, but I don't think so. Came with chili oil, scallions, and siracha on the side. It was good, and it's exactly what you expect to get, ramen and beef. Great flavor and the broth was well seasoned.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|                        | For our main course we had the BBQ sampler for two, as well as the shrimp and grits appetizer because I just couldn't help myself! The shrimp and grits were simply glorious. I may have preferred grilled or sautéed shrimp, rather than fried, but the other ingredients did a great job of balancing the richness of the fried shrimp and bacon. Marvelous.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

|                        | The sampler was very good, but not amazing. I had been particularly looking forward to the turkey, but they had run out (something we weren't told until after the food was delivered and I inquired about it). The hot links were our least favorite - just not our thing, I guess. The pulled pork was pretty good, but the ribs and brisket were definitely the stars, and our favorites by a mile.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

|                        | Since we brought up the missing turkey,  we were given a cobbler desert for free. That's about as much as I would pay for that dessert - $0 - as it tasted like hot, vaguely-fruity mush with a layer of raw flour on top. Whatever... they don't claim to be dessert experts, so what did I expect? I just know better for next time. ;)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |

|                        | Atmosphere is great - cozy, clean and modern. Just hipster enough to feel cool, but not so much to make you feel uncomfortable if you didn't show up with facial hair or a vintage t-shirt. Service is not as attentive as I would prefer, but most likely due to having too much to do, as opposed to a lack of effort. Everyone was very nice.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| 2skQeu3C36VCiB653MIfrw | This restaurant has the absolute best atmosphere. It starts from the moment you get out of your car and smell the aroma from the smokehouse. From there, it is dark inside which creates a calm homey feeling. The decor is perfect. The food is out of this world! Apple pie moonshine?

| 3ssvkvS64jO70_WwZ_qejw | Let me first start out by saying that the reason I gave this place two stars is for the fact that even though the food had absolutely no flavour in it it was fresh.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

| 5sTFevXhGx01eLT4wF7Urg | Great brunch spot! 4 mimosas for $10.. Can't beat that! Food was great... I had the poached eggs and my friend had an omelette. The fruit that was served was very fresh. The poached eggs had a truffle sauce and a side of artichokes with prosciutto! Delish!!

|                        | The chicken furikake is battered, deep fried and then glazed in this teriyaki-like sauce.  The batter has a good crunch despite the glaze and it's an addictive dish.  Knowing it's deep fried, I tend to shy away from these types of food, but I can never come to Island Flavor and not order this dish.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

|                        | The pulehu ribs has a dry rub versus the kalbi ribs more of a saucy seasoning are both salted heavy.  I always have to order my dish light on the sauce and the chef is more than happy to obliged.  I get an option to have brown rice instead of white rice, and then I replace my mac salad with sautéed vegetables.  This place offers a good medium for me.  Even though I'm having a cheat meal, I still get a dose of my healthier options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |

| 7T_2djdY6ldRugsuWb2S-A | Our group meets every Tuesday morning. Breakfast use to come cold and slow. I politely spoke to the server and explain the problem to her. For the last month our 10 to 14 breakfasts are fresh, being served on warm plates with hot coffee. Thanks for the good service.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| 8Jha7n3EY3_eRIMUOoJ4Zg | This was my first time eating at Zoup. It was a great experience. I had the Chicken Potpie soup with a half Turkey Club sandwich. This soup is their signature soup which is served every day. There are 100+ soup recipes with 12 served daily. They will let you sample any of the soups. The soup was excellent and the sandwich was good. The service was very friendly and the restaurant and bathroom was very clean.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |

| BskUTTscZ1XGa9ev7TlfeQ | Loved this place, great cocktails, great service. We got the gaint pretzel with smoked cheese. The pretzel is huge great for a large party. We both got steaks for dinner. And omg so delicious loved the duck fat potatoes and carrots. Love the style and feel of this place. I will definitely come back on my lunch break the desserts looked so yummy but was way to full to order.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |

| EwxhzR-VghhMsRObXLMitw | The service was ok. Food was bland. I've had several items, all were average. The huevos rancheros were a joke. More of a regular customer type of place, for people who don't want to go find good food.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| Ff3FKbwZ-fCT74G1F3_j1g | After a rough night of shopping I was ready to eat my new shoes I was so hungry. I'm in from NYC and am spoiled at home by all the healthy vegan and vegetarian options. As much as I like visiting Charlotte, there's usually more barbecue than vegetarian options.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |

I ordered the veggie d-lite wrap and it was fabulous. I wanted three more when I was done.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |

| Ff3FKbwZ-fCT74G1F3_j1g | The best food court meal I've ever had! The wraps, salads and flatbreads are made with such fresh and healthy ingredients, it's even hard to call this place a 'food court' restaurant... I think of it as more of a modern cafe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

|                        | The food is delicious! I am a frequent shopper of South Park mall and cannot help but go to Crunch every time. My favorites are the BBQ Santa Fe and Tilapia salads. I can't pick just one! I really like the crunch that the little tortilla strips give the BBQ Santa Fe. And don't even get me started on the delicious cilantro lime vinaigrette on the Tilapia salad.. I could seriously drink that stuff it's so good!! Most of the time, I would be wary to eat fish in a food court but never once have I second guessed Crunch's freshness! I talked to one of their employees and he told me they get all of their produce from a place in Rock Hill, SC. LOVE that they support local farmers and produce!  |
